This is the README file for Encode::HanConvert, two encoding
formats to facilitate mappings between traditional and simplified
Chinese characters.

* Installation

Encode::HanConvert uses the standard perl module install process:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install
enc2xs -C	# optional; updates Encode.pm's on-demand loading DB

You will need perl 5.7.3 or better, as well as Encode 1.41 or better
for Unicode-related functions. Otherwise, Encode::HanConvert::Perl
is used automatically, which provides perl-based implementations to
big5_to_gb() and gb_to_big5().

Regardless of the implementation, two command-line utilities ('b2g.pl'
and 'g2b.pl') are installed for simple conversion between GBK and Big5
encodings.

For this module's typical usage and examples, please consult its POD
documentation.
